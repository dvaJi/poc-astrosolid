Only within a few years, she defeated all her competitors utterly and made a huge fortune out of this, all while making glazed pottery much more available to ordinary households. The whole affair went on so quietly that even to this day, the merchants who used to sell glazed pottery as luxury items cannot figure out where went wrong. From their points of view, the potters all \"suddenly received guidance from an expert and disrupted the pottery market once and for all.\"\\nYet, as impressive as these machinations sound, the traveling merchant herself seems to almost forget about this.
